FAQ:

Q: what does this script do?
A: the purpose of this script is to obviate a funciontality currently missing on LEDE/OpenWRT backup/restore:
   -- to get a list of currently user installed packages (i.e: after flashing with squashfs-factory.img)
   -- to reinstall them on a newly flashed device presumably after a firmware upgrade (i.e: squashfs-sysupgrade.bin)
